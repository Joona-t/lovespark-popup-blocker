## : |2026-02-20|||fix(youtube): accurate counter + dedup guard for ad skip reporting

**Problem:** |2026-02-20|||fix(youtube): accurate counter + dedup guard for ad skip reporting
**Details:** - Rename skipAd→attemptSkip, onAdSkipped→reportSkip for clarity
- Fix polling fallback: was calling skipAd() but never reportSkip(),
  so ads caught by the interval were silently skipped without counting
- Add lastSkipReportedAt dedup guard (4s window) — MutationObserver
  and polling could both fire for the same ad state, causing double-counts

## : |2026-02-25|||fix: remove tabs/webNavigation/feedback permissions, drop link-breaking webNav listener

**Problem:** |2026-02-25|||fix: remove tabs/webNavigation/feedback permissions, drop link-breaking webNav listener
**Details:** Strip three unnecessary permissions (tabs, webNavigation,
declarativeNetRequestFeedback) for Chrome Web Store compliance.
Delete the webNavigation.onCreatedNavigationTarget popup-blocking
path that was closing user-initiated tabs. Popup blocking now
relies solely on the content-script window.open override.

## 2026-03-28: Fleet-wide automation regression — broken CSS variables + missing footers

**Problem:** A post-swarm-audit automation run injected `lovespark-tokens.css` and `lovespark-base.css` into popup.html, and replaced `--ls-pink-accent` with undefined `--ls-btn-bg` in popup.css. This broke toggle colors (rendered transparent) and changed disabled opacity from 0.4 to 0.9. Footer buttons were also missing from 26 extensions.
**Root cause:** Batch automation (`sync-shared-lib.sh` or swarm pass) overwrote extension CSS without validating variable definitions. The `--ls-btn-bg` variable was never defined in any CSS file.
**Fix:** Reverted all 76 git repos to last committed state. Fixed 3 extensions (cookie-nuke, breathe, planner) that had the bug baked into commits. Added footer buttons (LoveSpark Suite, Ko-fi, Report a Bug) to all 26 missing extensions. Updated shared lib footer to make LoveSpark Suite a proper link to lovespark.love. Deployed `guard-fleet-sync.sh` — 4-gate pre-sync validator that blocks automations introducing undefined CSS variables.
**Files:** popup.css, popup.html, lib/lovespark-footer.js, lib/lovespark-footer.css
**Commit:** fleet-wide fix, multiple commits
